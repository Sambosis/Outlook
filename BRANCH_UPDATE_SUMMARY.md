# Branch Update Complete! âœ…

## What Was Done:

### 1. Backed Up Old Main Branch
- Created `main-backup-old` with your previous main branch (the one with deduplication fixes)

### 2. Updated Both Main and Master
- Reset `main` branch to point to `origin/codex/change-email-storage-to-postgresql-yufni7`
- Reset `master` branch to the same commit
- Force pushed both branches to GitHub

### 3. Current State:
```
âœ“ main branch   â†’ 05541d1 "Ensure database tables initialize before email sync"
âœ“ master branch â†’ 05541d1 "Ensure database tables initialize before email sync"
âœ“ app.py has 665 lines (the working version)
âœ“ No syntax errors
```

## Routes Available in Working Version:
1. `GET /` - Homepage with recent emails
2. `GET /search` - Search emails
3. `GET /view/<int:email_id>` - View specific email
4. `GET /attachments/<int:attachment_id>/download` - Download attachment
5. `GET /list-attachments/<int:email_id>` - List attachments for email
6. `POST /check-emails` - Fetch new emails from Exchange
7. `GET /download-all-emails` - Download all emails as zip

## Set Main as Default Branch on GitHub:

Since your repository's default is still `master`, you should update it to `main`:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Sambosis/Outlook/settings/branches
2. Under "Default branch", click the switch icon next to `master`
3. Select `main` from the dropdown
4. Click "Update"
5. Confirm the change

## Deploy to Heroku:

Now you can deploy the working version:

```powershell
# Add heroku remote if not already added
heroku git:remote -a outlook-4463a5c16936

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main:master

# Check logs
heroku logs --tail --app outlook-4463a5c16936

# Initialize database if needed
heroku run python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()" --app outlook-4463a5c16936
```

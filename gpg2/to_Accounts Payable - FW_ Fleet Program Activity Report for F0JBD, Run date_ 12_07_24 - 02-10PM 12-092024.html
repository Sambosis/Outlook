The purpose of the attached "Fleet Program Activity" report is to keep you informed of activity in your account with the New York City Department of Finance's Fleet program.

The "Overpayment Processing" section alerts you to overpayments recently made by your company, as well as those that have been on your account for more than 30 days. It also details actions taken on your older overpayments, such as whether they were credited to your outstanding summonses in judgment or issued to you as a refund.

The "Outstanding Summons" section lists any new violations issued to your company and all outstanding violations that you still owe. Per an agreement that you previously signed with the Department of Finance, your agency will be subject to immediate termination from the fleet program if the total judgment amount due should exceed $350.

If your agency has recently been terminated from the program, you will continue to receive the weekly "Fleet Outstanding Summons" report until all the summonses issued to your vehicles while they were registered in a fleet program have either reached judgment or been satisfied. Thereafter, you will no longer receive this report.

Payments can be made in person at any Department of Finance business center, online at www.nyc.gov/ccweb, or by mail to:

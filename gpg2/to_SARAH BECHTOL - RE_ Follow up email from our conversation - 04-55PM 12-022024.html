Hi, I will research some facilities in the area and call him.  He will need to go into a facility within 24 hours for us to protect his job for 30 days while he is in the treatment center.
If he leaves early or doesn't go in then we can move forward with termination.

I'm glad he admitted something, and I really hope he takes this opportunity to get better.
Best,
Amy

Good morning joen,

          As per our conversation from this morning I am doing a follow up email, based on being clearly about certain things we spoke. I have confide in you about the problems of my mental health lately and the issue of alcoholism. As I am aware it has been affecting me in both my personal and professional aspects of my life. I admit I have a drinking problem and along with my mental health I have put the integrity of my workplace. I am willing to seek help and aggressively get better for myself personally and in hopes to get back to work with you guys. Please let me know what are my options, looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you again for taking the time this morning.

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following up with the information and recollection from the issue with Mint Room Baltimore:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We signed them to an agreement for 2 machines at their new Frederick location and installed the machines. I contacted the owner (Ashish) because we had an issue with a payment form to clear up. At that time, he expressed frustration to me about the lack
 of communication with his representative from the Baltimore Branch (Tim). Ashish had also reached out to my Route Supervisor, Brandon. See attachment 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon hearing of the lack of communication, I called Sam and asked him to call the customer. &nbsp;He assured me that he would, and stated that be believed the machine was scheduled to be installed the following week.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few days later (Nov 26), the customer and I communicated about the corrected form we needed. I asked at the time if he had heard back from Baltimore yet. He stated he had not. See attachments 2, 3, &amp; 4.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I texted Sam and stated that the customer says he has still not heard back from anyone, and that if there was no return call, he was going to sign with a competitor. I received no response to this text message. See attachment 5.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will forward to you the entirety of the email Ashish sent to Tim and copied me on. I believe it is dated Dec 5, and the customer stated to me that he had still not heard from anyone from the Baltimore branch.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I understand that I only have one side of the story here. But I must admit that I find the lack of communication very unsettling. On the same day, my Route Supervisor received a text from another of our customers struggling to get return communication
 from the Baltimore Branch about a new Baltimore location. We look bad here, and it has the potential of negatively affecting my branch as well as overall image of Auto Chlor. I'm also disappointed that Sam didn't respond to my last text message. Communication
 in our business is critical, especially between branches that share business owners. I would appreciate your follow-up and feedback on this issue before it gets elevated further. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

Hi fellas Iâ€™m routing through Chicago next week to NY for a few days, will start in 620 next wed am to work on production systems.

I plan to return last part of Jan will get 610 set up with a couple of pumps at that time. FYI I will be dividing majority of my time Q1 between NorCal & 600 production, frequently in 620 and 610 to help where I can.

XOXO and merry new year
